📊 Stock Market Analysis Using ARIMA & LSTM 🔥
I recently worked on a Stock Market Analysis project where I used ARIMA and LSTM models to predict stock prices. This project focuses on time series forecasting, leveraging Yahoo Finance data and deep learning techniques. Here’s a step-by-step breakdown of my approach! 🚀

1️⃣ Importing Libraries & Data
I started by importing essential libraries like Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, TensorFlow, and Statsmodels. The stock price data was retrieved using Yahoo Finance for the AAPL (Apple) stock from 2010 to 2024.

2️⃣ Data Exploration & Visualization
To understand the stock price trends, I plotted the closing prices over time. This helps identify trends, seasonality, and volatility in the stock market. 📈

3️⃣ ARIMA Model for Price Prediction
I used the Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) Test to check stationarity before implementing an ARIMA (5,1,0) model for time series forecasting. The model was trained and used to predict the next 30 days of stock prices.

4️⃣ LSTM Model for Deep Learning Forecasting
To enhance predictions, I implemented an LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) neural network with:
✅ Two LSTM layers (50 neurons each)
✅ Dropout layers to prevent overfitting
✅ Adam optimizer for model efficiency

I trained the model on 80% of the data and validated it on the remaining 20%. The predictions were then compared against actual stock prices. 📊

🔥 Key Takeaways
✅ ARIMA works well for short-term forecasting with a structured time series.
✅ LSTM provides deeper insights and adapts better to non-linear stock price movements.
✅ Combining traditional statistical methods with deep learning can improve stock market predictions.
